# Doggoscope

I point my Pi at dog pics, and it tells me stats.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run Web Server:

   ```bash
   flask --app api.index  run
   ```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000` and upload a dog picture to see the stats!
